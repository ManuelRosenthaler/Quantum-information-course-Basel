## Quantum Information: Project
# Additional Riddles

Inspired by the [Hello Qiskit Game](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-ex/hello-qiskit.html) I present: some additional riddles to solve!

The puzzles are created in a Jupyter notebook and can be played on the [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jupyter).
Simply import the notebook and start playing!
