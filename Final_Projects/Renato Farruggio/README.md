# SAT solver

This SAT-solver can build, run and evaluate quantum circuits for valid formulas.

## How to use
The entire manual to this tool can be found within the notebook. To open the notebook, you can download and use it. I've tried to setup a [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/) repository, but I didn't manage to use qiskit nor matlibplot from within there, so I'll leave that for now.
